This is a very realistic industry problem (log classification / log routing). I’ll answer exactly in industry terms, not research.

🔍 Problem Restated (Industry View)


10,000 log files


Each file ≈ 20,000 lines (very large)


8 known classes (labels exist)


Given a new log file, predict its class


This is document-level text classification with long inputs.

✅ INDUSTRY-STANDARD SOLUTION (MOST USED)
🥇 Log Feature Extraction + Classical Classifier

This is the #1 approach in real production systems


🏗️ Architecture Used in Industry
Step 1️⃣ Log Parsing / Template Extraction
Raw logs are too noisy.
Industry tools / ideas


Regex-based parsing


Drain / Spell / IPLoM (log template mining)


Replace variables:
ERROR user=1234 ip=10.2.3.4
→ ERROR user=* ip=*



👉 Result: log templates + frequencies

Step 2️⃣ File-Level Feature Construction
Convert each log file into a fixed-length vector
Common representations:


Template frequency vector


TF-IDF over log templates


N-gram of log messages


Statistical features


error count


warning count


unique templates





Step 3️⃣ Supervised Classifier
✔ Most used


Logistic Regression


Linear SVM


XGBoost (very common)


[Log File] → Feature Vector → Classifier → Class


Why this is industry-preferred
✔ Scales to huge logs
✔ Explainable
✔ Fast inference
✔ Works with limited labels
✔ No GPU needed

🔑 One-Line Industry Answer (Interview-Ready)

Industry classifies labeled log files by first extracting log templates, converting each file into a fixed-length feature vector, and training a supervised classifier like XGBoost or Linear SVM.

-----------------------------------classifers accepting embedding-----------------------------

Short answer: ❌ No — not all of them accept embeddings in a meaningful or practical way.
Long answer below (this distinction is very important in industry).

✅ What an embedding actually is

An embedding = fixed-length numeric vector
Example:

Text → Transformer → [0.12, -0.33, 1.04, ..., 0.27]   (768 dims)


From a pure math perspective:

Any model that accepts numeric vectors can accept embeddings

But industry ≠ math theory. Some models work well with embeddings, others don’t.

🟢 Models that ACCEPT embeddings WELL (Industry-proven)
1️⃣ Logistic Regression

Works well with embeddings

Common for:

Text classification

Semantic similarity

Risk scoring

Condition

Embeddings must be:

Normalized

Not too high-dimensional

2️⃣ SVM

One of the best classical models for embeddings

Widely used with:

Word2Vec

Sentence embeddings

TF-IDF

3️⃣ kNN

Natural fit for embeddings

Used in:

Semantic search

Recommendation

⚠️ Needs:

Cosine similarity

Vector normalization

4️⃣ MLP (Neural Networks)

Perfect fit

Embeddings are standard input

5️⃣ Autoencoders

Built for embeddings

Used for:

Dimensionality reduction

Anomaly detection on embeddings

6️⃣ Isolation Forest

Accepts embeddings

Used in:

Log anomaly detection

User behavior embeddings

⚠️ Works best when:

Embedding dimension ≤ ~300

Noise is limited

🟡 Models that ACCEPT embeddings but are NOT IDEAL
7️⃣ Random Forest

Technically accepts embeddings

Practically:

Trees split on single dimensions

Lose semantic meaning

Often underperforms vs linear models

8️⃣ XGBoost / LightGBM

Can accept embeddings

Works sometimes, but:

High dimensionality hurts

Correlations are hard to exploit

Usually need:

PCA / dimensionality reduction

9️⃣ Naive Bayes

Accepts embeddings mathematically

Conceptually wrong:

Assumes feature independence

Embeddings violate this

🚫 Rarely used with embeddings in practice

🔴 Models that do NOT directly accept embeddings
10️⃣ CNN / RNN / Transformer

❌ Do NOT accept precomputed embeddings as final input

They learn embeddings internally

You can:

Feed embeddings → fine-tune

But they expect sequences, not single vectors


-----------------------------------------classifiers  working with different type of input  data----------------------

Good question — this is exactly how industry thinks about model selection.

Below is a clear mapping of classifiers → what kind of input data they accept, with practical notes from production systems.
