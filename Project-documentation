This is a very realistic industry problem (log classification / log routing). I’ll answer exactly in industry terms, not research.

🔍 Problem Restated (Industry View)


10,000 log files


Each file ≈ 20,000 lines (very large)


8 known classes (labels exist)


Given a new log file, predict its class


This is document-level text classification with long inputs.

✅ INDUSTRY-STANDARD SOLUTION (MOST USED)
🥇 Log Feature Extraction + Classical Classifier

This is the #1 approach in real production systems


🏗️ Architecture Used in Industry
Step 1️⃣ Log Parsing / Template Extraction
Raw logs are too noisy.
Industry tools / ideas


Regex-based parsing


Drain / Spell / IPLoM (log template mining)


Replace variables:
ERROR user=1234 ip=10.2.3.4
→ ERROR user=* ip=*



👉 Result: log templates + frequencies

Step 2️⃣ File-Level Feature Construction
Convert each log file into a fixed-length vector
Common representations:


Template frequency vector


TF-IDF over log templates


N-gram of log messages


Statistical features


error count


warning count


unique templates





Step 3️⃣ Supervised Classifier
✔ Most used


Logistic Regression


Linear SVM


XGBoost (very common)


[Log File] → Feature Vector → Classifier → Class


Why this is industry-preferred
✔ Scales to huge logs
✔ Explainable
✔ Fast inference
✔ Works with limited labels
✔ No GPU needed

🥈 SECOND MOST USED (WHEN SEMANTICS MATTER)
Sentence-BERT / LogBERT Embeddings + Classifier
How


Sample or chunk log lines


Convert to embeddings


Aggregate (mean / max pooling)


Classify


Log → Chunks → Embeddings → Pooling → Classifier


Used when


Logs are unstructured


Natural language error messages


Cross-system generalization needed



🥉 USED IN BIG TECH / ADVANCED TEAMS
Transformer Models for Logs (LogBERT, BERT variants)


Pretrain on logs


Fine-tune for classification


⚠️ Costly, complex

📊 FINAL RECOMMENDED STACK (REALISTIC)
✅ Best Practical Choice

→ TF-IDF / Template Counts
→ XGBoost or Linear SVM

✅ Best Accuracy (Higher Cost)

🔑 One-Line Industry Answer (Interview-Ready)

Industry classifies labeled log files by first extracting log templates, converting each file into a fixed-length feature vector, and training a supervised classifier like XGBoost or Linear SVM.


If you want, I can:


Draw a production architecture diagram
